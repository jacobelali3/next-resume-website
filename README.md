This website was initially made with create-react-app which can be found [here](https://github.com/jacobelali3/react-resume-website). The homepage that loads a background video would experience a delay and the entire single page app was client loaded. I wanted the performance and potential of my website to grow. Therefore I decided to migrate to Next so i can load certain things on the server and focus abit more on page performance, i also moved some heavier files to AWS S3 & Cloudfront such as mp4 and video files. This also served as a way to introduce myself to Next.js (13).

This repo now serve as the new basis for my Portfolio / Resume website.
