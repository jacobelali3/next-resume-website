Honestly I felt guilty for making the client load the 'code mp4' video on homepage. Create-react-app is also pretty yucky. Therefore I decided to migrate to Next so i can load certain things on the server. This will also serve as a way to introduce myself to Next.js.

This repo will serve as the new basis for my Portfolio / Resume website.
